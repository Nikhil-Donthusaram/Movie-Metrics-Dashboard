# Movie Data Analysis Dashboard

This project explores various aspects of movie data, including popularity, ratings, genres, and revenue. The objective is to create interactive reports and visualizations that provide valuable insights into movie trends and patterns, preparing for more advanced data analysis projects in the future.

## Description
Movies are a significant part of the entertainment industry, and understanding their performance can provide meaningful insights. This project analyzes a movie dataset to examine factors such as popularity, ratings, genres, and revenue. The findings are presented through interactive dashboards to showcase trends and support decision-making in the movie industry.

## Problem Statement
The analysis addresses the following questions:
1. **Genre, Language, and Release Date Distribution**: What is the distribution of movies based on their genres, language, and release dates?
2. **Top-Rated Movies**: Which are the top-rated movies based on their rating and vote count?
3. **Popularity Over Time**: How does the popularity of movies vary over time?
4. **Successful Movies**: Which are the most successful movies based on their revenue?
5. **Ratings by Language and Genre**: How do the ratings of movies vary based on their original language and genre?
6. **Average Runtime**: What is the average runtime of movies based on their release year?
7. **Revenue by Genre**: How does the revenue of movies vary based on their genre?
8. **Language Frequency**: How does the frequency of each language compare to each other?
